# MyShare Portfolio Manager

### [See Demos](#symbol-lookup)

### DESCRIPTION

- This website manages users' stock portfolios - showing holdings, lots, and sells.
  - It shows users the profit they have made from selling, and the value increase of their current holdings.
  - It also gives users access to live stock information of any symbol.
- The website is hosted locally by running as a Python Flask app.
- The Flask app hosts all the pages of the app, along with API endpoints used by the front end.
- Yahoo Finance APIs are used to get current stock information.
<br>

### FILE INFO

- [**MyShareApi.py3**](MyShareApi.py3) defines logic for API endpoints and hosts the website.
  - User information is gathered and stored by connecting to the MyShare database.
  - Live stock information is gathered from Yahoo Finance APIs.
  - Passwords are encrypted using `passlib.hash.sha256_crypt` before being inserted into the database.
  - The API is hosted on localhost port 1817.

- The [**database**](database) folder contains the MyShare database (SQLite) and the SQL used to create it. The database includes:
  - a `Users` table
  - a `Holdings` table
  - a `PasswordReset` table
  - a trigger which automatically removes password reset codes that are more than 5 minutes old
  - multiple indexes to make common queries more efficient

- The [**templates**](templates) folder contains the HTML files for all front end webpages.

- The [**static/js**](static/js) folder contains the JavaScript files for all front end webpages.

  - Put the account's email address as the `ADMIN_EMAIL_ADDRESS` value and the account's password as the `ADMIN_EMAIL_PASSWORD` value in lines 19 and 20 of [**MyShareApi.py3**](MyShareApi.py3).
